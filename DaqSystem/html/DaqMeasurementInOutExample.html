%% System Objects to Stream Live Data to and from Data Acquisition Interfaces
% This examples shows how to exchange live data with Data Acquisition
% hardware using simple for or while loops and System object(TM)
% interfaces.

% Copyright 2014 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Introduction
% This example shows how to stream data to and from Data Acquisition
% interfaces using System objects and simple for or while loops. This is
% accomplished by using the System object dspdemo.DAQRecorder to
% acquire live data, and the System object dspdemo.DAQPlayer to generate
% live data.
% 
% These new objects only support live data streaming for the most common
% cases of AnalogInput and AnalogOutput functionality. For more advanced
% data acquisition requirements, please refer to the
% Data Acquisition Toolbox(TM) 
% <matlab:web('http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/daq/index.html')
% documentation>.
% 
% In the absence of relevant hardware, to preview the type of analysis
% possible the example can also be be run using pre-recorded data.
%
% Running the example requires DSP System Toolbox(TM). Using data
% acquisition hardware also requires Data Acquisition Toolbox.
% 
% To run with real hardware, the example assumes the machine it runs on
% has access to at least one Analog Input channel and one Analog Output
% channel, through one or more hardware devices supported by the
% <matlab:web('http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/daq/choose-the-right-interface.html')
% Session-based interface> of Data Acquisition Toolbox.

%% Measurement Setup
% The following figure shows the type of hardware setup used to acquire the
% pre-recorded data used in the example. If a similar setup is available
% the example can also be run in live mode.
% 
% The setup includes
% 
% * One AnalogOutput channel. In this example with an NI 9263 board
% * One AnalogInput channel. In this example with an NI 9201 board
% * A device under test. In this example a low-end audio amplifier
% * A standard connection between the devices and the computer running a
% MATLAB(R) session. In this case the two boards are mounted on an
% NI CompactDAQ chassis, which in turn is connected to the computer
% through USB 
% 
% <<HardwareConnections.png>>
% 
%% Sample objective - SNR measurements on a low-end audio amplifier
% The following code can be applied to many types of two-port electrical
% measurements. In particular, the example shows how to peform a simple
% Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) measurement on the output of a two-port
% network, using an 8 KHz sine wave as input.
% The recorded signal was generated using a low-cost audio
% amplifier. A sample rate of 96 KHz is used throughout.
% 
% To switch between using actual hardware or pre-recorded signals 
% create a logical variable runLive before running the example script.
% When runLive == false the example runs in recorded mode and no actual
% Data Acquisition interface is used. When runLive == true the example runs
% in live mode. In live mode a live test signal is sent to the analog
% output channel of the chosen Data Acquisition interface, and another
% signal is acquired through the selected analog input channel.
% By default the example runs in recorded mode.

% Check if runLive exists as a variable. If not, create it
% and set it to false
if(~exist('runLive','var'))
    runLive = false;
end

%% Create all necessary components
% First instantiate all components needed, from signal generation and
% analysis to the interfaces to hardware or the recorded data

% Main time and frequency simulation parameters
fs = 96000;     Ts = 1/fs;
f = 8000;       T = 1/f;
frameLength = 24000;

%%
% Input test signal: sine wave with frequency 8 KHz, sample rate
% 96 KHz and amplitude 50 mV

In = dsp.SineWave('Amplitude',0.05,'Frequency',f,'SampleRate',fs,...
    'SamplesPerFrame',frameLength);

%%
% Depending on the value of runLive, data is either acquired live
% or read back from pre-recorded files. 
if runLive

%%
% When runLive == true the following code executes.
% First an instance of dspdemo.DAQPlayer is created to connect MATLAB to
% an Analog Output channel and generate a live output data stream.
% To use dspdemo.DAQPlayer after creating an instance
%
% * Call the step method iteratively to pass data to the object
% * When the data is finished, call the release method to release
% the device and stop the data flow.
%
% The behaviour of dspdemo.DAQPlayer can be controlled using the
% properties
%
% * *DeviceName* identifies the particular device to be associated
% with the object. The list of all installed device on the machine
% in use can be inspected by typing e.g. Gen.DeviceName = ' 
% and then hitting the Tab key. To use this example in 'live' mode,
% please identify the relevant device description for the particular
% setup in use and replace it in the code below. If a value for
% DeviceName is not provided, it defaults to the name of the first
% available device found on the system.
% * *SampleRate* is the sample frequency to be used by the device
% * *FirstChannelNumber* is the first output channel number used
% by the device to produce the analog output signal. If the signal
% provided to the object has only one channel (i.e. the input matrix
% to the step method has only one column), then
% FirstChannelNumber is the identifying number of the channel used.
% If the input matrix passed to the step method has C columns, then
% the device will generate C signals in parallel over C different 
% channels, from channel number FirstChannelNumber to channel number
% FirstChannelNumber+C-1. If FirstChannelNumber+C-1 is greater than
% the number of channels available, then an error is produced.
% Please note that for a large number of devices the first channel
% is numbered as 0. The default value of FirstChannelNumber is 0.
% * *MeasurementType* can be either 'Voltage' or 'Current'
% * *TerminalConfiguration* can be set to 'Differential',
% 'PseudoDifferential', 'SingleEnded' and 'SingleEndedNonReferenced'. The
% device in use may only support a subset of these options
% * *OutputDeviceUnderrunStatus* when set to true, step returns a
% logical output that flags whether the internal queue was underrun.
% When the internal queue is underrun the device does not have enough data
% samples to feed its output channels and it stops generating signals
% as a result. The value returned by step can be used to exit an

% Next create an instance of dspdemo.DAQRecorder to connect MATLAB to
% an Analog Input channel and acquire a live input data stream.
% To use dspdemo.DAQRecorder after creating an instance
% * Call the step method iteratively to get data from the object
% * When the acquisition si to be terminated, call the release method to
% release the device and receiving data.
%
% Most properties of dspdemo.DAQRecorder have a similar role to
% those of dspdemo.DAQPlayer. The differences include the following
%
% * *SamplesPerFrame* is the number of samples per channels returned by
% step. The matrix output returned by step has a number of rows equal to
% SamplesPerFrame
% * *ChannelNumbers* must be a vector of integer values that defines which
% analog input channels are read from the device. The length of
% ChannelNumbers determines the number of columns of the output matrix
% returned by step. Please note that many devices number their channel
% numbers starting from 0. The default value of ChannelNumbers is 0.
% * *OutputNumOverrunSamples* when set to true, step returns an additional
% output, reporting the number of samples overrun since the previous call
% to step. The number is greater than zero when the code using the object
% does not read out samples using step frequently
% enough, causing the internal queue to be overwritten by new samples and
% previously acquired data to be lost.
% The additional value returned by step can be used to exit an execution
% loop when samples are overrun. The default value of
% OutputNumOverrunSamples is false.

%% Stream data using a while loop
% The following while cycle executes until endTime worth of test input
% signal samples are read from the analog input channel through

%% What to do in case of overrun or underrun
% To reduce the likelihood of underrunning the queue of
% dspdemo.DAQPlayer of overruning the queue of dspdemo.DAQRecorder, the
% following can be tried
%
% * Call setup before the first call to step for all System objects
% involved in the while loop
% * Increase the value of Gen.TargetLatencyFrames
% * Increase the value of SamplesPerFrame
% * Decrease the value of SampleRate

%% Estimate SNR - Spectrum Analyzer
% dsp.SpectrumAnalyzer can be used to run a number a quantitative signal
% measurements directly from within the scope. To visualize the SNR first
% open the Distortion Measurement pane by clicking on the relevant icon on
% the icon strip as shown in the figure below
% 
% <<SpectralMeasurementsSelection.png>>
% 
% The Distortion Measurement pane opens up showing harmonic distortions by
% defaults. the estimated SNR value is visible among other measurements
% towards the bottom on the pane. This SNR measurement assumes that the
% signal is harmonic, i.e. is composed of a high-power fundamental
% frequency, followed by a number of harmonics at frequencies multiple of
% the fundamental.
